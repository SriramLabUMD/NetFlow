# NetFlow
A tool to isolate the carbon flow through a metabolic network

NetFlow is self-contained in the master function 'NetFlow.m'. Check the help documentation for a description of the required inputs.

To replicate the data from Mack and Sriram (2021), run 'main_NetFlow_script.m'. Refer to publication or the comments within the scripts for a brief description of each step.

If you find any bugs/issues or have any questions/suggestions while using this code, please report them here or email Sean Mack (smack14@umd.edu) with 'NetFlow' in the title. I'm happy to help make NetFlow work within your framework.
